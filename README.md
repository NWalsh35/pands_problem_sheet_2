# Week 4:  collatz.py
# Week 4 task was to write a program that asks the user to input a positive integer.
# If the positive integer is an even number, divide the integer by 2. 
# If the postive integer is an odd number, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
# Have the program end at 2.

# Week 5: weekday.py
# 
# Website source 1: https://pynative.com/python-get-the-day-of-week/#:~:text=Use%20the%20weekday()%20method,%2C%2002)%20is%20a%20Monday.
# Website source 2: https://pythontic.com/datetime/date/weekday
#
# Aim: write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday.
# If the day of the week is a weekday, the program should output "Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday".
# If the day of the week is at the weekend, the program should output "It is the weekend, yay!"
# Reasoning behind my code:  Python converts each day of the week into an integer. Monday = 0, Tuesday = 1, Wednesday = 2, Thursday = 3, Friday = 4, Saturday = 5, Sunday = 6.
# I specified that x = the integer day of the week.
# If x is less than or equal to 4, i.e. Monday to Friday, then print "Yes, unfortunately today is a
# weekday"
# If x is >4, i.e. Saturday or Sunday, then print "It is the weekend, yay!"
# Used website "https://pynative.com/python-get-the-day-of-week/#:~:text=Use%20the%20weekday()%20method,%2C%2002)%20is%20a%20Monday."
# to get the day of the week as an integer but then I worked out the last part myself.
